summary: Ship smaller slices early so feedback arrives while changes are still cheap.

Most projects do not fail from hard implementation. They fail because teams wait too long before someone sees the work in context.

When I start a new build, I now aim for a first usable slice in days, not weeks. The point is not polish. The point is exposure.

Small feedback loops shift risk forward. You discover unclear assumptions earlier, while changes are still cheap.
