summary: Quiet seasons are for reducing friction and improving future execution speed.

Not every season has visible momentum. Some are for inventory: simplifying tools, cleaning architecture, and reducing future drag.

Quiet phases are valuable because you can hear system friction more clearly. You notice what breaks flow before external pressure hides it.

Build less, but make the path cleaner for when speed matters again.
