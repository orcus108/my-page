summary: rethinking healthcare for a billion people

when most people think about ai in healthcare, they imagine robots doing surgery or chatbots answering medical questions. that’s the version we usually see in tech news.

but india’s story with ai in healthcare is different.

in india, ai is not about making an already strong system slightly better. it’s about helping a system that is under pressure from day one. india has a population of more than 1.4 billion people and needs over 1.35 million doctors to properly serve them, with a shortage in the hundreds of thousands. that gap is not small. it affects how long patients wait, how quickly diseases are detected, and how much attention each person receives.

so the real question in india is not, “can ai improve efficiency?”
it’s, “can ai help us deliver care at all, at this scale?”

## ai as a support system, not a replacement

take tuberculosis, for example. india has one of the highest tb burdens in the world. there are simply not enough radiologists to review every chest x-ray carefully, especially in high-volume public hospitals.

ai tools trained to read chest x-rays are now being used in screening programs. in some real-world deployments, ai-assisted systems helped detect 30–40% more incidental tb cases that might have otherwise been missed. in other words, ai acts like a second pair of eyes. it doesn’t replace the doctor, but it reduces the chances of something serious slipping through.

the same pattern appears in breast cancer screening. traditional mammography machines are expensive and not easily available in rural areas. instead of trying to replicate western systems exactly, indian innovators built portable, radiation-free thermal screening tools powered by ai. in large community studies involving over 15,000 women, these systems showed that they could work at a population level.

this approach shows something important. ai in india is often designed around local constraints. it is simpler, more portable, and built for scale from the beginning.

## building the digital foundation first

ai only works well when it has structured data. if health records are scattered across paper files, nothing intelligent can be built on top of them.

that is why the ayushman bharat digital mission (abdm) matters so much. more than 670 million digital health ids (abha ids) have already been created. these ids allow patients to store and share health records securely across hospitals and clinics.

think of abdm as building highways before launching cars. it creates the basic infrastructure so that digital tools, including ai systems, can operate smoothly. once records are standardized and shareable, it becomes possible to track chronic diseases over time, train models responsibly, and improve public health planning.

without this foundation, ai would remain a collection of isolated experiments. with it, ai can become part of the system itself.

## moving from reaction to prediction

public health has traditionally been reactive. an outbreak happens, and then authorities respond.

now ai systems are being used to scan millions of news reports and public sources across multiple indian languages to detect early warning signs of disease outbreaks. these systems have flagged tens of thousands of structured health events while reducing the manual workload of surveillance teams.

this means health officials can act earlier. instead of waiting for cases to rise sharply, they can see patterns forming and respond in advance. over time, this shift from reactive to predictive could save resources and lives.

## solving the language barrier

one challenge that is easy to overlook is language. india has many languages, and not everyone is comfortable speaking or reading english. digital health systems built only in english automatically exclude millions of people.

the bhashini initiative uses ai to provide translation and speech tools in 22 indian languages. patients can describe their symptoms in their native language, and the system translates it for the doctor. prescriptions and instructions can also be made easier to understand.

this might sound simple, but it has a big effect. healthcare works better when patients clearly understand their condition and treatment. ai, in this case, removes a barrier that has existed for decades.

## genomics and local data

another important development is in genomics. for a long time, most global genetic datasets did not represent indian populations well. that means medical research and drug development were often based on data from other groups.

the genome india project sequenced 10,000 genomes across diverse ethnic groups to build a national reference dataset. this gives researchers and ai systems better data to work with. over time, it could lead to more personalized treatments and better understanding of diseases that affect indian populations differently.

training ai on local data is not about national pride. it is about accuracy.

## the less glamorous but critical uses

not all ai in healthcare is dramatic. some of the most important uses are behind the scenes.

ai systems are being used to predict bed availability, manage icu monitoring, and optimize hospital supply chains. hospitals that adopt predictive resource tools have reported significant operational savings.

when hospitals run more efficiently, patients wait less, staff feel less overwhelmed, and critical supplies are less likely to run out. these improvements may not make headlines, but they improve daily care.

---

## the role of regulation and trust

healthcare is sensitive. if patients do not trust digital systems, they will not use them.

india’s digital personal data protection act requires explicit consent for data use and sets clear responsibilities for organizations handling health data. regulatory guidance also treats ai systems as evolving tools that must be monitored and updated carefully.

this governance layer is essential. ai cannot function safely in healthcare without strong rules and accountability.

## what makes this different

when you step back, you see a pattern.

india is not simply adding ai tools to hospitals. it is building a digital backbone — health ids, interoperable records, language tools, surveillance systems, and genomic databases — and then embedding ai into that structure.

this approach is ambitious. it aims to increase national capacity, not just automate tasks.

there are still challenges. awareness of digital systems is uneven. internet access varies. training healthcare workers to use new tools takes time. technology alone cannot fix deeper systemic issues.

but the direction is clear.

india is treating ai not as a shiny feature, but as part of the basic infrastructure of modern healthcare.

if this model works at india’s scale, it could become an example for other countries facing similar constraints.

the question now is not whether ai can be used in healthcare.

it is whether we can build the right systems around it — systems that are fair, inclusive, and truly helpful to patients.

if we succeed in doing that, what might healthcare look like for the next generation?
